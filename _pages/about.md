Welcome! The site is still under development. Will be updated shortly.

About Me
======

I am a 6th year PhD candidate in the Neurobiology department at Duke University specializing in computational neuroscience and more broadly neural engineering. I am a senior member of the [Pearson Lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io), lead by Dr. John Pearson, where collectively we build software tools for neuroscience applications. My project focus on building a real-time tool for detecting latent patterns for oscillatory neural data. 

Interests
------
Beyond neural tool development, I am also interested in brain-computer interfaces, scientific policy, teaching/mentoring and entrepreneurship


Objectives
======
1. Get the tool publsihed online
